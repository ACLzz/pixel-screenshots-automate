# Pixel Screenshots Automation
When you use Pixel Screenshots for the first time, you may find that you have 500+ screenshots and you don't have "Process all" button. So Google implies to wait for "automated processing" (it processes about 15-20 overnight), or you to go and click every screenshot one-by-one. \
I don't agree with such approach, so I invented my "Process all" button, and this button is a simple python script that utilizes adb.

## What do you need?
- Linux
- Install adb
- Install python
- Allow debugging on your smartphone (in developer settings)

## How to run?
- Open your pixel screenshots app
- Run main.py 
- Profit :)
